git init command is the building block of a project,it contains and houses
all the collection of files the makes up a repo
the staging area is like preparing our files ready for commit . it si more or less
go between for our working directory and repo
by using git reset to unstage file we can make sure we are adding one logical change
per commit.
in order to make experimental changes to our code its good to know how to use branches.
we merge two branches to be able to collaborate on a project and save experimental changes
